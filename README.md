retrieving data from a JSON file and storing data in the db.json file. The frontend was 
provided for this challenge. It will also be deployed to Heroku.

## Installation

To install this generator a user could clone the repo to their vscode terminal then open an integrated terminal in the index.js file. Then type npm i, and hit enter. Then type node server.js, and hit enter.

## Usage

To use this application. After following the installation instructions just type a title name
for your note, then in the text area type the details of the note you want to create, then hit the
new note button and your note and title will be saved in the sidebar. The note titles in the sidebar can be 
clicked on to view the text details and edit or delete the selected note.

## Credits

I did not have any collaberation on this project other than my tutor Trinh Nguyen, who helped me so much with getting my routes straightened out so it would actually save and delete the notes. She has been teaching me how to better use the combination of the localhost browser and the terminal to debug my code. The rest of the code in this app came from our class activities and the code that is in them, which I used as templates for this challenge. 
Specifically, 
Activities: 3 Api-HTML Routes in server.js, 9 Static-Assets in server.js, 13 Post-Requests in server.js, 
20 Data-Persistance in server.js, 21 Modularized-Routing in route files, 28 Mini-Project in route files.
I also just received some very helpful guidance from a TA in class who is named Marc and he helped me with 
some syntax issues in the server.js file and he helped me with the deployment to heroku. Very helpful and enlightening.
